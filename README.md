This web application provides an interactive route optimization tool for the Delhi-Meerut corridor, allowing users to visualize and calculate optimal routes while considering real-time traffic conditions. The application uses a genetic algorithm to find the most efficient path while avoiding high-traffic segments based on user-defined parameters.

  -> Features
. Interactive Traffic Controls: Adjust traffic conditions for each route segment

. Dynamic Route Optimization: Visualize the best route based on current traffic conditions

. Traffic Avoidance Threshold: Set your tolerance for high-traffic segments

. Real-time Visualization: See the route update as the algorithm runs

. Performance Statistics: View estimated travel time and avoided high-traffic segments

     -> How It Works
1. Traffic Conditions Setup:

. Adjust sliders to set traffic conditions for each route segment

. Set the traffic avoidance threshold (default: 1.5x normal traffic)

2. Route Optimization:

. Click "Calculate Optimal Route" to start the genetic algorithm

. Watch as the algorithm evolves better routes over 50 generations

. The best route is displayed with color-coded traffic conditions

3. Results:

. View the optimized route on the interactive map

. See estimated travel time and number of avoided high-traffic segments

   -> Technical Details
1.Algorithm: Genetic algorithm with:

. Tournament selection

. Single-point crossover

. Mutation with path repair

. Fitness function that considers both distance and traffic conditions

2. Visualization:

. Canvas-based route rendering

. Responsive design that adapts to screen size

. Color-coded segments based on traffic conditions:

. Green: Low traffic (<0.8x normal)

. Yellow: Normal traffic (0.8-1.2x normal)

. Red: High traffic (>1.2x normal)

  -> Installation
No installation required - this is a standalone HTML file with embedded JavaScript. Simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser.

Usage
1. Open index.html in your web browser

2. Adjust traffic conditions using the sliders

3. Set your preferred traffic avoidance threshold

4. Click "Calculate Optimal Route" to find the best path

5. View the results in the visualization panel

  -> Dependencies
. Chart.js (loaded from CDN)

. Modern web browser with JavaScript support

  -> Roadmap
Potential future improvements:

1. Add real-time traffic data integration

2. Include more route options and alternative paths

3. Implement user location detection

4. Add time-of-day traffic patterns

5. Include road type considerations (highway vs. local roads)
